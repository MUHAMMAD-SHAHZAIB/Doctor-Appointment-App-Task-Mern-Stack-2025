# Doctor Appointment System - Functional Documentation

## System Overview

The Doctor Appointment System is a comprehensive web application that connects patients with doctors, facilitating the booking and management of medical appointments. The system serves three types of users:

1. **Patients** - Regular users who can browse doctors, book appointments, and manage their medical visits
2. **Doctors** - Medical professionals who manage their availability and handle patient appointments
3. **Administrators** - System managers who oversee users, departments, and the overall system

## Core Features

## Technical Implementation Overview

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built as a RESTful API with the following components:

- **User Authentication**: The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB database stores all user data, appointments, and system information
- **API Endpoints**: Various endpoints handle operations for users, doctors, departments, and appointments
- **Business Logic**: Complex logic handles availability checking, appointment scheduling, and access control

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built as a React single-page application (SPA):

- **State Management**: Uses Context API with reducers to manage application state
- **Routing**: Implements role-based routing to direct users to appropriate pages
- **UI Components**: Combines Material UI components with custom components
- **Data Fetching**: Connects to backend API using Axios to retrieve and update data

## Role-Based Access Control

Access to features is strictly controlled based on user roles:

### Patient Access

- Browse doctors and departments
- Book, view, and cancel own appointments
- Update personal profile
- View medical records from appointments

### Doctor Access

- View and update own doctor profile
- Manage availability schedule
- View and update assigned appointments
- Add medical information to appointments

### Administrator Access

- Full system management capabilities
- Create, read, update, and delete all resources
- Manage all users, including role assignments
- Handle department and doctor management

## Key System Interactions

### Appointment Booking Process

1. Patient selects a doctor from the list
2. System retrieves doctor's availability schedule
3. Patient selects a date from the available dates
4. System displays available time slots for that date
5. Patient selects a time slot and provides appointment details
6. System validates the selection to ensure the slot is still available
7. System creates the appointment and marks the slot as booked
8. Both patient and doctor are now able to see the appointment in their dashboards

### Appointment Management Process

1. Doctor views list of upcoming appointments
2. Doctor selects an appointment to view details
3. Doctor can add medical information:
   - Diagnosis of the patient's condition
   - Prescription instructions
   - Additional remarks or instructions
4. Doctor updates appointment status (completed, no-show)
5. Patient can view the updated appointment with medical information

### Availability Management Process

1. Doctor accesses their availability settings
2. Doctor selects which days of the week they work
3. For each working day, doctor adds time slots:
   - Start time and end time for each slot
   - Multiple slots can be added per day
4. System saves the availability schedule
5. When patients try to book, only the open slots are displayed
6. When a slot is booked, it's marked as unavailable to prevent double booking

## Dashboard Features

## Security Considerations

The system implements several security measures:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with expiration for secure authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control on all operations
- **Data Validation**: Input validation on all forms to prevent injection attacks
- **Error Handling**: Proper error management without exposing sensitive information

## System Limitations
